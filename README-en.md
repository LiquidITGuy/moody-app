## Introduction

Moody app is an open source project to help bipolar people.

You will retrieve the website [here]() to answer your question and access the app [here.]()

three needs are covered :
- Those disorders is commonly misunderstood (even by the concerned people).
- Each people have different symptoms and requires a custom follow-up.
- Existing apps are complex, or users need multiple apps. More of that the collecting data is mainly obscure.

The goal of the app and the website will be to answer clearly at those three problems.

Be careful, this app will not replace a medical follow-up.
